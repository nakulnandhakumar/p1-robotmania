# Week 1

Nakul Nandhakumar and Vihan Jayaraman:

-- Worked on Battleship GUI using SwingDesigner

-- Successfully adapted control code to new UI

-- Kept text and console based elements in code to work in tangent with UI control code

-- Worked on adapting control code for potential ship overlaps

-- Experimented with instantiating GUI after extending GUI class file in other classes

Sara Beniwal:

-- Worked on Connect Four GUI using SwingDesigner

    -- Planned out the GUI's appearance: 7 columns, 6 rows; color scheme; buttons to indicate drop
    
-- In the process of revising repl.it code to function with GUI

    -- No longer an array; needs to be removed and connected to new GUI gameboard
    
    -- User no longer required to input which column to drop; instead must press button corresponding to column
    
    -- Check for win and player turn algorithms should stay the same



TO-DO

-- Aesthetical improvements to GUI for user satisfaction

-- Adapt control code to better handle ship overlaps and conditions

-- improvements to technical ease of user interaction needed (ex. button pressing, more intuitive button placement/text/names etc.)

-- Potenitally start UI for monopoly/tick-tack-toe/hangman games??? 

-- Work on adding a playerBoard for enemy to guess and attack player ships
