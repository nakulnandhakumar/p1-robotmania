**Nakul Nandhakumar and Vihan Jayaraman: Self-Grade 5/5** 

I think that Vihan and I deserve a 5/5 as we have worked on the Battleship code throughout the week. I created and added the GUI for the Battleship, adpated the control code to fit the GUI, and improved some of the GUI aesthetics (which still need more work). Vihan copied over all the Battleship code and worked on improving certain aspects of the gameplay, like adjusting win condition variables in case of ship overlaps. Originally, Vihan couldn't get Github to work so I added the code which Vihan told me to add so it might look like Vihan didn't contribute to the code but in reality he did.

-- Worked on Battleship GUI using SwingDesigner

-- Successfully adapted control code to new UI

-- Kept text and console based elements in code to work in tangent with UI control code

-- Worked on adapting control code for potential ship overlaps

-- Experimented with instantiating GUI after extending GUI class file in other classes

**TO-DO**

-- Aesthetical improvements to GUI for user satisfaction

-- Adapt control code to better handle ship overlaps and conditions

-- improvements to technical ease of user interaction needed (ex. button pressing, more intuitive button placement/text/names etc.)

-- Potenitally start UI for monopoly/tick-tack-toe/hangman games??? 

-- Work on adding a playerBoard for enemy to guess and attack player ships

**Sara Beniwal: Self-Grade 5/5**

-- Worked on Connect Four GUI using SwingDesigner

-- Planned out the GUI's appearance: 7 columns, 6 rows; color scheme; buttons to indicate drop
    
-- In the process of revising repl.it code to function with GUI

-- No longer an array; needs to be removed and connected to new GUI gameboard

-- User no longer required to input which column to drop; instead must press button corresponding to column

-- Check for win and player turn algorithms should stay the same

**TO-DO**

-- Improve and finalize look of Connect Four Gameboard

-- Add clear instructions for user experience

-- Finalize code with comments to explain each part

-- Potentially start new UI project w fellow teammates

**Sanvi Pal: Self-Grade 4/5**

I think that I should get a 4/5 because I worked on the Hangman GUI and ceated the corresponding algorithm that goes along with it. I think that should lose one point though because I procrastinated and didn't make the syntax for the hangman global and only made it local.

-- Created algo to run hangman with GUI: Will expand size of white rectangle on top of the robot for every wrong answer in order to create illusion of disappearing robot

-- Work on familiarizing myself with java syntax related to GUI

-- Embedded external asset (image) to GUI of game

-- Created calculator with 12 buttons

**TO-DO:**

-- Finish Hangman GUI Version Code

-- Make progress on TrioCalculator 2.0

-- Plan Monopoly

**Yasaswi Singamneni: Self-Grade 5/5**
 
 I think that I deserve a 5/5 because I worked in the HelloGame GUI and adapted the control code to match thr GUI.
 
 -- Started working on GUI version of HelloGame
 
 -- Started making new memory game GUI
 
 -- Used Git to upload previous code to repo
 
 **TO-DO**
 
 -- Push code for HelloGame GUI version after fixing some bugs
 
 -- Finish Memory Game GUI
