# Week 2 - Advocacy Week

This readme entails both information about our project as well as our progress throughout this week. As an overview, our project focuses on incorporating UI into games such as Battleship, Connect Four, and Hangman to provide an interactive appeal to the user. Instead of playing games on the console, they can use a more user-friendly version with simple to understand buttons, intriguing graphics, and vivid colors. Each member has made sure to make their own mark on the project, through the multiple games the user can choose from.

# Overview of Project

**Battleship:** Are you a fan of the classic two person game? Well here is our twist of the game using Java! In this code, you can choose buttons to hit at your opponents targets. Additionally, our easy to use interface makes the game much more simple and enjoyable.

**Connect Four:** Try this UI version of Connect Four! Press buttons that coordinate to certain columns to "drop" your pieces. Play with a friend and compete to see who will make four in a row first! *Please note: Currently a work in progress*

**Hangbot:** A fan of hangman? Check out hangbot, a single player game that will test your guessing ability. With a plethora of words and an engaging UI, you will be sure to enjoy this game! *Please note: Currently a work in progress*

**Calculators:** As MVC is a key part of this project, we have incorporated the calculators assignment to this readme. Take a look at our calculators, some of which are a work in progress (Sara and Sanvi's. We have almost finished the two versions and are now in the process of connecting them).
